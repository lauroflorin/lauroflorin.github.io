# Motivation
 We want to find out if humans have discovered yet that lab rats and dolphins are smarter than them so our question is: whoâ€™s the smartest animal in town? 

* __The dataset__
The posts from 3 Facebook groups:

* Animal Cognition - 6 956 posts

* Animal Cognition, the Emotional and Intellectual Lives of Animals - 10 364 posts

* Anthrozoology - 7 442 posts

* 24 762 posts in total, 78.3 MB of pickles


* __Choice of dataset__
We decided that these were the 3 most relevant Groups: Animal Cognition, Animal Emotional Lives, Anthrozoology. Since these facebook groups are all about science, more specifically the intelligence of animals, our assumption is that if a post on these groups mentions an animal, that animal must be smart.
