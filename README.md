# Motivation
 We want to find out if humans have discovered yet that lab rats and dolphins are smarter than them so our question is: whoâ€™s the smartest animal in town? 


* __Choice of dataset__

We decided that these were the 3 most relevant Groups: Animal Cognition, Animal Emotional Lives, Anthrozoology. Since these facebook groups are all about science, more specifically the intelligence of animals, our assumption is that if a post on these groups mentions an animal, that animal must be smart.

* __Goal for the end user's experience__
